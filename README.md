# ðŸš— Voice Controlled Rover (HC-05)

A small Arduino-based rover that can be controlled using **voice commands** via Bluetooth (HC-05) and an Android app.

## ðŸ”§ Components
- Arduino UNO/Nano
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- Motor Driver (L293D or Motor Shield)
- DC Motors + Chassis
- Battery Pack
- Android Phone with App

## âš¡ How It Works
1. Speak a command in the Android app (e.g., "Forward", "Left", "Stop").  
2. App sends the command via Bluetooth â†’ HC-05.  
3. Arduino receives it and drives the motors accordingly.  

## ðŸš€ Future Ideas
- Add obstacle avoidance  
- Voice control without internet  
- Upgrade with sensors
